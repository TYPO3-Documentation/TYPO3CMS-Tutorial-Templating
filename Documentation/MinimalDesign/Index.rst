================
A minimal design
================

Here, we intend to construct a design that produces an HTML web page with the
least effort. This design can serve as a test of system output or as an
illustration of the minimum required templating steps.

For this minimal design, in a TYPO3 CMS backend, create a standard page named
:aspect:`Minimal design` just under (inside) the page tree TYPO3 logo
container. On this standard page, create a new TypoScript template record.
Give the new TypoScript template a title, and make it a rootlevel template,
but do not include any static templates.

The TypoScript-only version
===========================

In the TypoScript template Setup field, write the following three lines::

   page = PAGE
   page.1 = TEXT
   page.1.value = Hello, world.

View the resulting web page.

This TypoScript-only design has the fewest instructions needed to produce a
web page from TYPO3 CMS. This TypoScript template contains its own content:
there are no other files or database records needed. Changing that content
requires edit-capable access to the TypoScript template itself. Adding to
that content can quickly become complex due to TypoScript syntax rules.

The TYPO3 Fluid version
=======================

Empty the “Minimal design” page TypoScript template Setup field, then write
the following three lines in the field::

   page = PAGE
   page.1 = FLUIDTEMPLATE
   page.1.file = fileadmin/sitedesign/Resources/Private/Templates/Minimal.html

Create a file named :file:`Minimal.html` in a
:file:`fileadmin/sitedesign/Resources/Private/Templates` folder. Notice that
the initial letter in the file name is capitalized: some parts of Fluid may
not find a file if its name doesn’t start with a capital letter. Write the
following single line in the file:

.. code-block:: none

   Hello, world.

View the resulting web page.

This TYPO3 Fluid design puts the page content into a file, allowing separate
access controls and preparing for editing that doesn’t need attention to
TypoScript syntax rules. The TYPO3 CMS renderer still requires a TypoScript
template on the “Minimal design” page, to know what file to process for web
page content.

Resulting web page
==================

Here is the resulting web page HTML source for both the TypoScript-only and
the Typo3 Fluid minimal designs. Notice how TYPO3 CMS added default markup
surrounding the single line of content:

.. code-block:: html

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
      <head>
         <meta charset="utf-8">
