""""""""""

This tutorial comes to an end. You can probably imagine other tasks that
you would perform on a real web site. You can try your hand at them based
on what you have learnt so far.

In this tutorial we built the web site by adding marks and
subparts to an HTML file and mapping them to a TypoScript template,
which is a very common way to do templating in TYPO3 CMS.

There are other possibilities (which might be covered in future tutorials):

- using the TYPO3 extension `automaketemplate: <http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/automaketemplate>`_,
  which basically works the same way we learned in this tutorial
  but which automatically wraps up those sections of an HTML page
  which have certain classes or ids in corresponding template subparts.

- using only TypoScript, without any HTML template, for building the website .

- using the Fluid templating engine by applying the FLUIDTEMPLATE
  object rather than the TEMPLATE object.

To complete your knowledge of TypoScript, you may want to look at the
:ref:`t3tssyntax:start`. You will learn how to use constants,
include TypoScript templates into one another, store your TypoScript
in text-based files and much more.

The reference for all objects, functions and data types is
- as always - the :ref:`TypoScript Reference <t3tsref:start>`.
