In this tutorial, you will learn how to build up a web-site using the TYPO3 CMS.

This tutorial teaches you how to:

- use an HTML document as a template for a TYPO3 CMS website.

- integrate the HTML document into the TYPO3 CMS system as a basis for all pages

- set up the TYPO3 CMS to insert the content of each page into the HTML template

- create text-based dynamic navigation menus.

The result of the tutorial is a site similar to the Introduction Package.
This tutorial also includes an HTML and a CSS files which are used for practice.

Skill level
^^^^^^^^^^^

This tutorial assumes you are a beginner-level site developer and contains step by step instructions,
for you to create your first TYPO3 CMS website, based on an HTML file (this file will be supplied for the tutorial).

You will learn how to integrate a template into the TYPO3 CMS system, known as  "Integration" in the TYPO3 CMS world.


.. _skills:

Skills
^^^^^^
A basic knowledge of HTML is necessary (detailed knowledge is not). Knowledge of CSS is not mandatory. 

Before you begin, please read the :ref:`TypoScript in 45 minutes tutorial <t3ts45:start>`.
It is not necessary that you read and understand everything and every detail. Skimming it for a basic understanding is enough.
This tutorial should give you an overview of TYPO3 CMS.
However, we will also repeat concepts in the Templating Tutorial where they are needed.


.. _what-s-new:

What's new
^^^^^^^^^^

This is the first version of this manual. It replaces the old "Modern Template Building Tutorial",
which was originally written in 2003. Although we have tested the descriptions in this manual,
there might still be places, which somehow are not clear or understandable.

If something remains unclear when you are working through the manual, please drop us a note!

Either write us a mail to documentation@typo3.org or create a new issue in the issue tracker
of this manual at https://forge.typo3.org/projects/typo3cms-doc-templating/issues
(to create an issue you will need an account on typo3.org).

Thank you!
